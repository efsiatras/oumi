"""
Unit tests for the Oumi multi_agents module which integrates CAMEL capabilities.

These tests verify the core functionality of the multi_agents module, including:
1. Chat agents (ChatAgent)
2. Role-playing capabilities (RolePlayingSession, RolePlaying)
3. Adapters for Oumi models (create_agent_model)
4. Toolkits (various toolkit implementations)
5. Code execution capabilities
6. Memory management (AgentMemories)
7. AI Society role-playing

Note: These tests use mocking extensively to avoid dependencies on external services
and to provide deterministic testing of the core functionality.
