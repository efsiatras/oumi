# JAX inference config for Llama 3 8B with INT8 quantization.
# This reduces memory usage by ~50% with minimal quality loss.
#
# ⚠️ Experimental: JAX backend is under active development
#
# Requirements:
#   - Install JAX dependencies: `pip install oumi[jax]`
#   - GPU with at least 12GB VRAM recommended
#
# Usage:
#   oumi infer -i -c configs/examples/jax_inference/llama3_int8.yaml
#
# Performance:
#   - Memory: ~12GB (vs ~24GB for FP16)
#   - Speed: Similar to FP16 with optimized kernels
#   - Quality: Minimal degradation (<1% perplexity increase)
